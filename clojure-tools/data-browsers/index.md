# Clojure Data Browsers

> #### TODO::work in progress, sorry

Clojure is a very data oriented language.   Information is represented as data using Clojure hash-maps and vectors.  As the size of data increases it is seful to have tools to browse thorugh that data.

* Clojure functions (TODO)
* Editor data browsers (cider-inspect, etc.)
* [Reveal](reveal.md) repl with data browser, also a `tap>` source (new project)
* [Portal](https://github.com/djblue/portal) - tool to navigate your data (new project)
* [Clojure inspector](clojure-inspector.md) (Java Swing based inspector)
* REBL data browser - originally part of Datomic Clojure database (free for non-commercial projects)
