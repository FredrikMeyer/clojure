A REPL prompt displays and will evaluate code entered.

Up / down arrow keys to navigate the REPL history

* Loading a file
* changing namespace
* requiring a namespace
* reloading a namespace

> #### Hint::Workflow regardless of tooling
> An editor is typically used rather than the command line repl, however, the above workflow is still the same.
