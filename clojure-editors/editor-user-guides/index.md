# Editor User Guides - The Basics

We would like you to spend as much of your time at the workshop learning Clojure, so here are some guides that just cover the essential usage of our recommended editors.

## Clojure development with Vim
[vim-iced](https://github.com/liquidz/vim-iced) and [Conjure](https://github.com/Olical/conjure) both provide Clojure development tools for Vim and Neovim.

[Spacemacs](emacs-spacemacs.md) provides first class support for Vim style editing.
