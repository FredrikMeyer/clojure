# Practicalli Minimal Project Template

A Clojure project with minimal dependencies and example code, useful for experimenting or building a new project from a minimal setup.


## Using the project

Run the REPL

```shell
make repl
```

The REPL prompt is displayed using Rebel for a rich UI experience.

Portal data inspector window is displayed and all evaluation results and mulog events are automatically sent to Portal.

An nREPL server is running in the background for connecting Clojure aware editors.


Run tests (stopping on first failing test)

```shell
make test
```
