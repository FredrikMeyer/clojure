# Coding Challenges for Clojure

![Clojure coding challenges](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/practicalli/graphic-design/live/code-challenges/clojure-code-challenges.png)

Coding challenges are an excellent way to start learning a new language.  The challenges allow you to focus on the language and not be concerned about the more general engineering aspects of software development.

Challenges are there to explore a language and practice your understanding of how to assemble working code.  It is recommended to try different approaches to solving a challenges and even repeat the same challenges at a later date and see what additional approaches you have learned.

[Exercism.io](https://exercism.io){target=_blank} and [4Ever-Clojure](https://4clojure.oxal.org/){target=_blank} are highly recommended starting point for learning Clojure and does not require any installation or setup.  4Ever-Clojure is a new implementation of 4Clojure.com.

## Practicalli Challenges

Challenge that can be solved in a few hours (or less).  Use a [Clojure REPL connected editor](/clojure/clojure-editors/) to help solve these challenges. 

- [Simple Projects](/clojure/simple-projects/)
- [TDD Code Kata](/clojure/simple-projects/tdd-kata/)


## Approach to solving challenges

Take a few minutes to digest the description of the challenge and make notes.

Identify the simplest possible thing to do, solving the problem in many small pieces which encourages experimentation

- experiment, write code and evaluate to see what it does (optionally create a comment with the result)
- use a rich comment `(comment ,,,)` to capture multiple ideas and designs, even failed experiments can be useful (separates experiments from working code)
- continually evaluate code as expressions are written, to ensure their behaviour is understood (try different argument values for functions)
- try different shapes of data
- transform data shapes to keep function definitions simpler

Once there is a working solution, refactor or try different approaches and evaluate the merit of alternative solutions

## Challenge websites

A local Clojure development environment supports solving challenge websites, e.g [Clojure CLI](/clojure/install/clojure-cli.md) and a [Clojure REPl connected editor](/clojure/clojure-editors/index.md)
