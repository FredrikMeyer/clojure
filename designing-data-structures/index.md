# Designing Data Structures

Some common design guides for data structures in Clojure 

# The Basics design approach 

Most data structures in Clojure seem to be created from either vectors or maps or a combination of both.

Vectors are the most flexible data structure in Clojure and support random access as they are indexed.

Maps are really useful for defining semantic meaning to your data structures, helping you create data structures that express the context of the model they represent.
