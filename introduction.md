  Clojure is a simple, powerful and fun language to develop any and all applications. It has a simple syntax that is quick to learn and a wide range of Clojure libraries to build any kind of apps and services. Its also easy to use any existing Java / JVM Language code or libraries as part of your Clojure apps.

In this workshop we take a hands on approach where everyone takes Clojure code and experiments with it using the REPL (interactive runtime environment). You will quickly get a feel for Clojure by evaluating, breaking, fixing and extending code in the REPL, all the while getting instant feedback on what your code is doing.

As we work through code we will discuss the concepts behind Clojure, including functional programming, "pure" functions and a stateless approach with persistent data structures, changing state safely, Java interoperability and tooling around Clojure.

> "A lot of the best programmers and the most productive programmers I know are writing everything in Clojure and swearing by it, and then just producing ridiculously sophisticated things in a very short time. And that programmer productivity matters." Adrian Cockcroft - Battery ventures, formally Cloud Architect, Netflix
