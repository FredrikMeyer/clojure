# Clojure Study guide

A suggested study guide for those new to functional programming with Clojure.

> #### Hint::MeetAMentor Clojure Study Group - 3rd November 2018 onwards
> [MeetAMentor Community](http://meetamentor.co.uk/) is hosting a Clojure Study group starting 3rd November, using this study guide.  Sign up via the[ MaM Study Group form](http://bcrw.typeform.com/to/VkChxI).

## Week1: Overview of Clojure

[![youtube live recorded broadcast](/images/youtube-live-recorded-broadcast.png)](https://youtu.be/MZcuL4lRw5E)

Briefly discuss what the Clojure programming languages is good for, some example companies using Clojure and give suggestions on how to start learning Clojure.

Cover [the syntax and a few common functions](https://repl.it/@jr0cket/Clojure-In-15-minutes),

### Homework
* Simple Clojure exercises from [ClojureBridge London workshop](https://clojurebridgelondon.github.io/workshop/simple-values/)
* Understand the principles behind the design of the Clojure language by watching [Simple made Easy](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy) by Rich Hickey (the author of Clojure)

## Week2: REPL Driven Development overview and ClojureBridge London exercise review

[![youtube live recorded broadcast](/images/youtube-live-recorded-broadcast.png)](https://youtu.be/y5TAHwZc1JE)

Discuss REPL Driven Development ([my blog post on the topic](http://jr0cket.co.uk/2018/11/REPL-driven-development-with-Clojure.html))

Review the ClojureBridge London exercises homework - [Github Gist](https://gist.github.com/jr0cket/6551c8ef224a63e891bc61665471bcd1) - [Repl.it project](https://repl.it/@jr0cket/ClojureBridge-London-exercises)


### Homework
* [4Clojure exercises](http://www.4clojure.com/)


## Week 3: Using the REPL and Structural editing

[![youtube live recorded broadcast](/images/youtube-live-recorded-broadcast.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmSPKvlJk74)

Structural Editing for Clojure development and the concept of code as symbolic expressions.  Demonstrating the basic of structural editing using Spacemacs

Briefly covers the different editors that give a good Clojure experience.
http://practicalli.github.io/clojure/development-tools/

Visit http://practicalli.github.io/spacemacs to learn more about Clojure development with Spacemacs (Emacs and CIDER).

### Homework
* [4Clojure exercises](http://www.4clojure.com/)
* Install a Clojure development environment using these [install guides for several Clojure aware editors](https://practicalli.github.io/clojure/development-tools/)



## Clojure session at London Java Community

Assuming I give a talk at the LJC conference on Saturday 24th, I will endeavour to broadcast live.

[![youtube live hangout on air](/images/youtube-live-hangout-on-air.png)](https://hangouts.google.com/hangouts/_/4hpko5efv5cahm25qdtklnc5bye)

I will also attempt to broadcast live a lightning talk on how to broadcast live (because I like being quite meta some times).



## Week 4: Live code a simple application

Build a simple application from scratch (probably a simple encoder / decoder)

## Week 5: Data Structures and Immutability

Understanding how to model the world with immutable data (values)

Homework: writing a simple encoder/decoder challenge and more 4Clojure exercises

## Week4-8: Thinking Functionally
* Writing your own (pure) functions
* using sequences
* lisp comprehension
* higher order functions
* functional composition.

Homework: various small challenges and 4Clojure exercises.

## Resources for practising Clojure
* [4Clojure](http://www.4clojure.com/)
* [Exorcism](https://exercism.io/)
* [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/)

Demonstrate how to use the REPL in [Spacemacs](http://practicalli.github.io/clojure/development-tools/#spacemacs) and [Atom.io with ProtoREPL](http://practicalli.github.io/clojure/development-tools/#atom-protorepl).  Demonstrating evaluation of code, structural editing, refactoring, etc.
