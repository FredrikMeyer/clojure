# When to use Clojure 

  Clojure is a general purpose language, so you can use it for any kind of application.  
  
  Areas where Clojure really excels include:
  
  * **dealing with data** 
    - most applications take data, do something with it and return it 
  
  * **high scalability through parallelism** 
    - as Clojure code is mostly immutable, you can run millions of instances for massive processing power


So Clojure is great for webapps, data science, big data, finance industry (banking, trading, insurance, etc), devops tools (log analysis, etc) and anything else really.

> **Hint** You can also use ClojureScript which generated JavaScript that will run in a browswer, or ClojureCLR that will compile to the Mirosoft common language runtime
