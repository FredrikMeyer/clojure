# Small Projects
An effective way to get comfortable with Clojure is to start writing small projects.  In this section several small projects are used to walk the audience through how to create and develop a project, as well as learn some Clojure functions and functional programming techniques along the way.


| Project                                            | Topics         | Description                                                                                |
|----------------------------------------------------|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Random Clojure Function](random-clojure-function) | namespace vars | command line application that displays a random function from the Clojure standard library |
| Salary Calculator                                  | hash-map       | Calculate salaries for permanent and contract roles                                        |
